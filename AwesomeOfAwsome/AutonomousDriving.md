Autonomous driving technology is developing rapidly and nowadays first autonomous rides are being provided in city areas. This requires the highest standards for the safety and reliability of the technology. Motion prediction part of the general self-driving pipeline plays a crucial role in providing these qualities. In this work we present one of the solutions for Waymo Motion Prediction Challenge 2022 based on MultiPath++ ranked the 3rd as of May, 26 2022. Our source code is publicly available on GitHub.

# Workshops and Resources 


## https://cvpr2022.wad.vision/
The CVPR 2022 Workshop on Autonomous Driving (WAD) aims to gather researchers and engineers from academia and industry to discuss the latest advances in perception for autonomous driving. In this one-day workshop, we will have regular paper presentations, invited speakers, and technical benchmark challenges to present the current state of the art, as well as the limitations and future directions for computer vision in autonomous driving, arguably the most promising application of computer vision and AI in general. The previous chapters of the workshop at CVPR attracted hundreds of researchers to attend. This year, multiple industry sponsors also join our organizing efforts to push its success to a new level.
